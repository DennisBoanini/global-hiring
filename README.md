# Global Hiring

Have you ever spent a lot of time applying for a remote job just to find out the company you're applying to doesn't hire in your country?
This happened to me. That's why I've decided to create a list of companies hiring globally.

My goal here is to group companies with a global hiring policy. This means: Companies that don't have restrictions on where you can live.
Companies hiring US only, East Coast only, Europe only, etc. shouldn't be included here.

**Some context:** There are lots of lists for remote companies. [@yanirs](https://github.com/yanirs) has this [awesome established remote companies list](https://github.com/yanirs/established-remote), for example. We also have websites such as [RemoteOK](https://remoteok.com/) and [FindAsync](https://www.findasync.com/) where we can find remote jobs. However, many remote companies don't hire globally.

**Contributions are welcome.**
